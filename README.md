# Tutorial: Project-Portfolio

This project is a personal *portfolio website* designed to create a **dynamic and smooth browsing experience**. It intelligently **adapts the user interface** as you scroll, like making the navigation bar appear differently or revealing a handy 'scroll to top' button. Content on the page **gracefully fades or slides into view** as you discover it, and navigation within the page happens with **gentle, smooth transitions**. Crucially, it uses **efficient techniques** to animate elements like skill bars, ensuring the website remains **fast and responsive**.
